## Contribute to the Sveltime Open Source Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sveltime!

Know that you'll need a Svelte based test app that you will be able to run in dev mode. 

The extension folder is where you'll find Chrome dev tool parts of our application. The rest is built as a svelte app with most of the communication from front-end to back-end within App.svelte. 

Things we have planned but not yet implemented: 

* Time-jump/Snapshot: This will be the ability to store changes of state within a specific render as a snapshot and to jump between snapshots and visualize their differences.

* FlowChart: Use d3 to view components in different forms and manipulate the data.

* Stores: Currently we only visualize Svelte components. If you can integrate visualization of Svelte stores, that would be terrific!

* Revisualize State: Think of new ways to display the organization of state within and between components.


We're also very excited to see and hear the changes you have in mind for Sveltime! 

Feel free to reach out to any of us if you have any questions or concerns.
